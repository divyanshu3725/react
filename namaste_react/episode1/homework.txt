WHAT IS EMMET?
- they are set of abbreviations and shortcuts that allows developers to write HTML and CSS code quickly.
- these abbreviations and shortcuts can be expanded into HTML or CSS code
- they come integrated with IDEs
- in HTML we use emmets for:
  a. definig relationships between elements while building sturcture (ul>li)
  b. creating nested element structure (div>ul>li*3)
  c. creating multiple similar elements at once (li*3) 
- in CSS we use emmets as shorthands for:
  a. properties (m10)
  b. goupings (p, div, h1)

DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN LIBRARY AND A FRAMEWORK
- flexibility
  - libraries offer flexibility by allowing developers to choose how to structure their code and when to invoke library functions
  - frameoworks are less flexible as developers need to adhere to the framework's architecture and conventions
- control
  - in libraries the developers control the flow of application
  - in frameoworks the frameowork controls the flow of application
- functions
  - libraries provide functions that developers use for faster development
  - frameoworks provided a pre-established structure for development, a comprehensive and integrated set of tools, 
- examples
  - libraries: jQuery, lodash, unserscore, react, d3, three, chart, moment, axios, anime
  - frameoworks: angular, vue, ember, backbone, svelte, express, meteor, nest, adonis

CDN
- A Content Delivery Network is a network of distributed servers strategically located across the globe to deliver web content
- CDN links refer to the URLs of assets that are served through a Content Delivery Network.
  
ADVANTAGES OF USING CDN LINKS
- faster load times (web content are cached on multiple servers globally, when a user requests a particular resource, it's fetched from the nearest server)
- ensures global accessiblity of web content (as servers are located at different locations accross the globe) 
- offeer ease of scalability (as load is distributed across multiple servers)
- result in cost savings (by reducing bandwidth usage) (bandwidth usage is reduces due to optimized delivery of content)

REACT v/s REACTDOM
- they are two separate packages in the React ecosystem
- react package is the core library for building User Interfaces
- react dom package is the library which is used for rendering react components or react elements into DOM

REACT.DEVELOPMENT.JS v/s REACT.PRODUCTION.JS
- react.development.js is used in the development environment
- react.production.js is used in the production environment
- it includes additional warnings and informative error messages
- it omits development-specific features, warnings, debugging tools, to reduce file size and improve runtime performance
- development version builts are larger in size due to inclusion of additional development tools 
- production version builts are smaller in size because smaller size files are more suitable for production deployments (where file size and load times are criticla)

ASYNC v/s DEFER
