WHAT PROBLEMS DOES REACT SOLVE?
- it simplifies the creation, management and utilization of reusable UI components
- it minimizes DOM manipulations by introducing virtual DOM
- it simiplifies state management
- it introduces the use of JSX

HOW DO BROWSERS RENDER REACT CODE IF THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT?
- react is typically written in JSX, which isn't understood by browsers
- JSX code is transpiled into plain javascript using tools like Babel

WAYS TO GET REACT INTO MY PROJECT
- using CDN links
- installing it using the package manager
- using creat react app

WHAT'S ACTUALLY BEHIND THOSE REACT FUNCTIONS?
- all that react gives us are encapsulated versions of some complex javascript code

JSX
- is a syntax extension of JavaScript
- allows us to write HTML like code in JavaScript
- allows us to embedd JavaScript expressions within curly braces {}
- supports component composition
- enhances the readability of our code
- supported by IDEs

VIRTUAL DOM
- is a lightweight representation of DOM
- it's a javascript Object that mirrors the structure of real DOM
- helps to minimize the amount of DOM manipulation to be done
- how 
- the newly created virtual DOM is compared with the older one
- minimum changes that needs to be done are calculated
- and then only these changes are made

WHY ARE DOM MANIPULATIONS COSTLY
- on manipulating DOM, browsers reflow and repaint the affected elements and these things are computationally expensives
- DOM manipulations are generally synchronous, so they can block the execution context
- they many trigger additional network requests

REFLOW
- calculation of positions and sizes of elements in the DOM tree
- is trigerred when changes are made on the layout (changing width of element, height of an element, margin of an element, padding of an element etc)

REPAINT
- updating the visual representation of elements on the screen
- is less expensive than reflow
- is triggered when visual properties of an element are changed (like color, background-color, border-color etc)

WHY IS REFLOW MORE EXPENSIVE THAN REPAINT
- because layout changes on a single element propagates some layout changes to many elements
- while visual changes on a single element doesn't propagate changes to any other element

BTS OF RENDER METHOD
- the component we supply inside the render function is converted into javascript object which represent a virtual dom element, and then this vitual dom element is added to the original dom after the diffing and reconcilation mechanisms

EMMET 
- they are set of abbreviations and shortcuts that allows developers to write HTML and CSS code quickly.
- they come integrated with IDEs
- in HTML we use emmets for:
  a. defining relationships between elements while building sturcture (ul>li)
  b. creating nested element structure (div>ul>li*3)
  c. creating multiple similar elements at once (li*3) 
- in CSS we use emmets as shorthands for:
  a. properties (m10)
  b. goupings (p, div, h1)

LIBRARY v/s FRAMEWORK
- flexibility
  - libraries offer flexibility by allowing developers to choose how to structure their code and when to invoke library functions
  - frameoworks are less flexible as developers need to adhere to the framework's architecture and conventions
- control
  - in libraries the developers control the flow of application
  - in frameoworks the frameowork controls the flow of application
- functions
  - libraries provide functions that developers use for faster development
  - frameoworks provided a pre-established structure for development, a comprehensive and integrated set of tools, 
- examples
  - libraries: jQuery, lodash, unserscore, react, d3, three, chart, moment, axios, anime
  - frameoworks: angular, vue, ember, backbone, svelte, express, meteor, nest, adonis

CDNs
- A Content Delivery Network is a network of distributed servers strategically located across the globe to deliver web content
- CDN links refer to the URLs of assets that are served through a Content Delivery Network.

ADVANTAGES OF USING CDN
- faster load times (web content are cached on multiple servers globally, when a user requests a particular resource, it's fetched from the nearest server)
- ensures global accessiblity of web content (as servers are located at different locations accross the globe) 
- offeer ease of scalability (as load is distributed across multiple servers)
- result in cost savings (by reducing bandwidth usage) (bandwidth usage is reduces due to optimized delivery of content)

REACT v/s REACT DOM
- they are two separate packages in the React ecosystem
- react package is the core library for building User Interfaces
- react dom package is the library which is used for rendering react components or react elements into DOM

REACT.DEVELOPMENT.JS v/s REACT.PRODUCTION.JS
- react.development.js is used in the development environment
- react.production.js is used in the production environment
- it includes additional warnings and informative error messages
- it omits development-specific features, warnings, debugging tools, to reduce file size and improve runtime performance
- development version builts are larger in size due to inclusion of additional development tools 
- production version builts are smaller in size because smaller size files are more suitable for production deployments (where file size and load times are criticla)
