- all the code is kept inside the src folder
- makes separate file for every component
- but at the end of the day parcel will bundle all the js code inside a single .js file 
- inside the src folder, we will make a components folder
- inside the components folder we will place our Header component, Body component
- all these stuff isn't necessary 
- component file name should be same as the component name
- component file names should start with a captial letter
- component file names can either have .js or .jsx
- we placed the Header component inside Header.jsx file and exported it from there
- we will import it into App.js
- first export and then import
- never keep hardcoded data (like imagecardarray and toprestaurant and url links) in components folder
- keep them in constants.js or mockdata.js
- module cannot have multiple default exports
- if we want a module to do multiple exports then we need to use the named exports
