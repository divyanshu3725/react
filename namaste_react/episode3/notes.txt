// PROPS
// we use props to pass data to components
// props is short for properties
// components at the end of the day are normal functions
// props at the end of the day are normal arguments to the functions
// props are used to pass dynamic data to components

// CONFIG DRIVEN UI
// when our user interface is driven by data or configs, we call the UI a config driven UI

// CLOUDINARY IS A CDN

// KEYS
// help react to distringuish between which element has been updated, which element is new, which element is the same as it was
// but why react want to know this?
// so that it re-renders only the new stuff and not the old stuff
// giving indices as key's values is a bad practice
